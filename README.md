# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

This repository contains the study material and practice sheets for the course CS345A conducted during Fall 2023-24 session.


The ideal way to study the course is to go through all the class notes and solve (or at least spend time thinking the solution to) the homework problem questions that the professor left for the student to work out (which I almost never did). The other suggestion is to read the book [**Algorithm Design**](./lectures/Jon%20Kleinberg,%20Eva%20Tardos%20-%20Algorithm%20Design-PEARSON_Addison%20Wesley%20(2005).pdf) and solve the practice problems. This will help you to get a flavor of questions that may be asked in quizzes (specially the hard ones), and believe me this book has proved to do wonders for me throughout the course.

I have hereby included:
- **All lecture slides**
- **Practice sheets** and hints to some questions (was very lazy by the end to write the solutions to the problems, or maybe didn't know how to solve :0. Anyways you'll find the solution to most of the problems on StackOverflow or Algoritms Design)
- **Worked out assignments** (one of the most necessary components throughout the course, would recommend to always go through them, the professor might ask you to do the partial or whole analysis of the problem given in the assignments, which are nothing but brownie points)

Hope this helps :)
